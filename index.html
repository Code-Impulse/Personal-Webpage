        <td><p>I love soccer because I am good at running and love the concept of kicking, since I'm good with my feet. I would recommend this sport to anyone who is willing to practice and try hard. Soccer is good because it is good for your physical health and is very competitive. My best goal was from half-field when I curved the ball into the goal, winning the match. In my opinion soccer is a really good sport.</p></td>
        <td><p>I love Minecraft because it is a game in which we can do anything from our wildest dreams. Some people have even made moving houses in this game. I would recommend this game to anyone with a big imagination and anyone who like to put in long hours to accomplish something. Below is a cool Minecraft house that is like one that I had made.</p><img src="Minecraft_House.jpg" alt=" Minecraft House"><p>""My New Minecraft House" by Uriel 1998 is licensed with CC BY 2.0.
